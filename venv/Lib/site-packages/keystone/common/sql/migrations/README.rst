Migrations for the database
===========================

This directory contains migrations for the database. These are implemented
using `alembic`__, a lightweight database migration tool designed for usage
with `SQLAlchemy`__.

The best place to start understanding Alembic is with its own `tutorial`__. You
can also play around with the :command:`alembic` command::

    $ alembic --help
