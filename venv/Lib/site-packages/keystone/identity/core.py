class Manager(manager.Manager):
    """Default pivot point for the Identity backend.

    See :mod:`keystone.common.manager.Manager` for more details on how this
    dynamically calls the backend.

    This class also handles the support of domain specific backends, by using
    the DomainConfigs class. The setup call for DomainConfigs is called
    from with the @domains_configured wrapper in a lazy loading fashion
    to get around the fact that we can't satisfy the assignment api it needs
    from within our __init__() function since the assignment driver is not
    itself yet initialized.

    Each of the identity calls are pre-processed here to choose, based on
    domain, which of the drivers should be called. The non-domain-specific
    driver is still in place, and is used if there is no specific driver for
    the domain in question (or we are not using multiple domain drivers).

    Starting with Juno, in order to be able to obtain the domain from
    just an ID being presented as part of an API call, a public ID to domain
    and local ID mapping is maintained.  This mapping also allows for the local
    ID of drivers that do not provide simple UUIDs (such as LDAP) to be
    referenced via a public facing ID.  The mapping itself is automatically
    generated as entities are accessed via the driver.

    This mapping is only used when:
    - the entity is being handled by anything other than the default driver, or
    - the entity is being handled by the default LDAP driver and backward
    compatible IDs are not required.

    This means that in the standard case of a single SQL backend or the default
    settings of a single LDAP backend (since backward compatible IDs is set to
    True by default), no mapping is used. An alternative approach would be to
    always use the mapping table, but in the cases where we don't need it to
    make the public and local IDs the same. It is felt that not using the
    mapping by default is a more prudent way to introduce this functionality.

        If a hints list is provided, the wrapper will insert the relevant

        honor it. If the driver does truncate the response, it will update the
        'truncated' attribute in the 'limit' entry in the hints list, which
        enables the caller of this function to know if truncation has taken
        place. If, however, the driver layer is unable to perform truncation,
        the 'limit' entry is simply left in the hints list for the caller to
        handle.

        A _get_list_limit() method is required to be present in the object
        class hierarchy, which returns the limit for this backend to which
        we will truncate.

        If a hints list is not provided in the arguments of the wrapped call
        then any limits set in the config file are ignored.  This allows
        internal use of such wrapped methods where the entire data set is
        needed as input for the calculations of some other API (e.g. get role
        assignments for a given project).

        This method, specific to identity manager, is used instead of more
        general response_truncated, because the limit for identity entities
        can be overridden in domain-specific config files. The driver to use
        is determined during processing of the passed parameters and
        response_truncated is designed to set the limit before any processing.
